# Login Issue Solution - Complete Fix

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

Your login issue is caused by a **Row Level Security (RLS) policy problem** on the `vendor_user_vendors` table:

1. ✅ **User exists** in Supabase auth (`dj@mixmasterpro.com`)
2. ✅ **User password is set** (`password123`)
3. ✅ **Vendor data exists** (DJ MixMaster Pro)
4. ✅ **User-vendor link was created** in the database
5. ❌ **RLS is enabled on `vendor_user_vendors` table with NO policies**
6. ❌ **This means NO ONE can read from the table** (including the user themselves)

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The `vendor_user_vendors` table has RLS enabled but no policies defined. This creates a security lockdown where:
- ❌ No one can INSERT (fixed with service role key)
- ❌ No one can SELECT (this is why login fails)
- ❌ No one can UPDATE or DELETE

## 🛠️ **Solution: Fix RLS Policies**

### **Option 1: Run SQL Script in Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/fix-vendor-user-link-manual.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the script

This will create the necessary RLS policies to allow users to access their vendor links.

### **Option 2: Manual RLS Policy Creation**

If you prefer to create policies manually, run these SQL commands one by one:

```sql
-- Allow users to read their own vendor links
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own vendor links" ON vendor_user_vendors
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to insert their own vendor links
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own vendor links" ON vendor_user_vendors
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to update their own vendor links
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own vendor links" ON vendor_user_vendors
FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to delete their own vendor links
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own vendor links" ON vendor_user_vendors
FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

After running the RLS policy fix:

1. **Test Login**: Try logging in with `dj@mixmasterpro.com` / `password123`
2. **Verify Access**: The user should now be able to access their vendor data
3. **Check Dashboard**: Navigate to `/vendor-dashboard` to verify full functionality

## 📋 **Current Test Account Status**

- **Email**: `dj@mixmasterpro.com`
- **Password**: `password123`
- **User ID**: `cd9bdb69-71c8-4026-ab2a-876fa391a8de`
- **Vendor ID**: `1`
- **Status**: ✅ User created, ✅ Password set, ✅ Link exists, ❌ RLS blocking access

## 🔒 **Security Notes**

The RLS policies we're creating ensure:
- Users can only access their own vendor links
- Users cannot see other users' vendor relationships
- The system remains secure while allowing proper functionality

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the SQL script** in Supabase dashboard
2. **Test the login** with the test credentials
3. **Verify full functionality** by accessing the vendor dashboard
4. **Delete the test scripts** if everything works correctly

## 📚 **What We Fixed**

1. ✅ **Environment Variables**: Created proper `.env.local` file
2. ✅ **Service Role Key**: Verified service role key is working
3. ✅ **User Creation**: Created test user in Supabase auth
4. ✅ **Password Setup**: Set user password to `password123`
5. ✅ **Vendor Link**: Created user-vendor relationship
6. 🔄 **RLS Policies**: Need to run SQL script to complete

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After fixing the RLS policies, the login system will work correctly:
- Users can authenticate with their credentials
- Users can access their vendor data
- The system maintains proper security boundaries
- All vendor functionality will be accessible

**Note**: This issue occurred because the project is transitioning from SQLite to Supabase, and the RLS policies weren't properly configured for the new authentication system.
