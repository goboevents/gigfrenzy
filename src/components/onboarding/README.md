# Vendor Onboarding System

A comprehensive, multi-step onboarding experience for vendors to sign up and set up their profiles on the platform.

## Overview

The vendor onboarding system offers two signup flows:

### 🚀 **Quick Start Flow (Email-First)**
1. **Email Landing** - Submit email to create account and receive verification
2. **Account Setup** - Complete personal info, business name, website, phone, and password
3. **Continue to Full Onboarding** - Complete remaining steps for full profile

### 📋 **Complete Onboarding Flow**
1. **Account Setup** - Personal info, business name, website, phone, and password
2. **Business Profile** - Business details and description
3. **Service Categories** - Selection of services offered
4. **Location & Availability** - Service areas and scheduling
5. **Documentation** - Required document uploads
6. **Pricing & Packages** - Service pricing structure
7. **Review & Submit** - Final review and application submission

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`OnboardingContainer`** - Main container that manages the multi-step flow
- **Step Components** - Individual components for each onboarding step
- **Progress Tracking** - Visual progress indicators and step navigation
- **Data Management** - Centralized state management across all steps

### Key Features

- **Modular Design** - Each step is a separate, reusable component
- **Builder.io Integration** - All components are registered for visual editing
- **Responsive UI** - Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS
- **Form Validation** - Client-side validation with error handling
- **Progress Persistence** - Data is maintained between step navigation
- **Flexible Navigation** - Users can move between completed steps

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import { OnboardingContainer } from '@/components/onboarding'

const onboardingSteps = [
  {
    id: 'account-creation',
    title: 'Account Creation',
    description: 'Create your vendor account',
    component: AccountCreationStep,
    isComplete: false
  },
  // ... more steps
]

export default function VendorOnboarding() {
  return (
    <OnboardingContainer
      title="Complete Your Vendor Profile"
      subtitle="Join our platform and start offering your services"
      steps={onboardingSteps}
      showProgressBar={true}
      allowStepNavigation={true}
    />
  )
}
```

### Customizing Steps

Each step component accepts standard props and can be customized:

```tsx
<AccountCreationStep
  stepData={existingData}
  onComplete={handleStepComplete}
  onNext={goToNextStep}
  onPrevious={goToPreviousStep}
  isFirstStep={true}
  isLastStep={false}
  allData={allOnboardingData}
/>
```

## Builder.io Integration

All components are automatically registered with Builder.io for visual editing:

- **Component Registration** - Each component is registered with inputs and styling options
- **Visual Editing** - Non-technical users can customize layouts and content
- **Reusability** - Components can be used in other parts of the application
- **Customization** - Colors, text, and layout can be modified through the Builder.io interface

### Available Builder.io Components

1. **Onboarding Container** - Main flow container with progress tracking
2. **Email First Landing** - Email capture and account creation
3. **Account Setup Step** - Complete account information form
4. **Business Profile Step** - Business information form
5. **Service Categories Step** - Service selection interface
6. **Location & Availability Step** - Geographic and scheduling setup
7. **Documentation Step** - File upload interface
8. **Pricing & Packages Step** - Pricing structure setup
9. **Review & Submit Step** - Final review and submission

## Data Flow

### Step Completion

1. User fills out step form
2. Form validation occurs
3. `onComplete` callback is triggered with step data
4. Data is stored in the container's state
5. User is automatically moved to the next step

### Data Persistence

- All form data is maintained in the `OnboardingContainer` state
- Users can navigate between completed steps without losing data
- Data is only submitted when the final step is completed

### Validation

- Each step includes client-side validation
- Required fields are clearly marked
- Error messages are displayed inline
- Users cannot proceed without completing required fields

## Styling & Theming

### Tailwind CSS Classes

The system uses Tailwind CSS for consistent styling:
- Responsive grid layouts
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Interactive states (hover, focus, disabled)
- Color schemes that can be customized

### Customization Options

- **Colors** - Background, text, and accent colors
- **Layout** - Container width, padding, and margins
- **Typography** - Font sizes, weights, and families
- **Components** - Individual step styling and behavior

## Accessibility Features

- **Keyboard Navigation** - All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Screen Reader Support** - Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management** - Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Error Handling** - Accessible error messages and validation feedback

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive design
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading** - Step components are loaded as needed
- **State Management** - Efficient state updates and re-renders
- **Form Optimization** - Debounced input handling and validation
- **Bundle Size** - Components are tree-shakeable and modular

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-language Support** - Internationalization (i18n)
- **Advanced Validation** - Server-side validation and real-time feedback
- **Analytics Integration** - Step completion tracking and user behavior analysis
- **A/B Testing** - Different onboarding flows for optimization
- **Offline Support** - Progressive Web App capabilities
- **Integration APIs** - Third-party service integrations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Step Navigation Not Working** - Ensure all step components are properly imported
2. **Form Data Not Persisting** - Check that `onComplete` callbacks are properly implemented
3. **Builder.io Components Not Showing** - Verify component registration and API key configuration
4. **Styling Issues** - Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the environment variable:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_ONBOARDING=true
```

## Contributing
